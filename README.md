# zf2-circlical-trans

Magic glue to connect ZfcTwig, the ZF2 Translator, and Twig's {% trans %}.  Usage is very simple; with this package included, modify your app config to add the "trans" extension this codebase provides.


### Requirements


|Item              |  Version     |
|------------------|--------------|
|PHP               | 5.5+         |
|Zend Framework    | 2.3.*        |


### Installation

Add this line to composer, and update:

```js
"saeven/zf2-circlical-trans": "dev-master",
```

### Configuration

In your module's application.config.php, make sure you've got these modules loaded:

    'ZfcTwig',
    'CirclicalTwigTrans'

By loading CirclicalTwigTrans, you will be setting an alias from 'translator' to 'MvcTranslator'.  If you have an existing translator alias in your system, please remove it.

It's assumed that you are managing locale in your app's bootstrap.  For example, in your Application module's onBootstrap:

```php
public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e)
{

    $translator = $e->getApplication()->getServiceManager()->get('translator');
    $translator
        ->setLocale( 'fr_CA' )
        ->setFallbackLocale( 'en_US' );
}
```

### Usage

Use 

```twig
{% trans "This is a sentence" %} 
```
to translate that string.

You can also do pluralization with:

```
{% set name = "Morpheus" %}
{% trans %}
   Hi {{ name }}, I took one blue pill.
{% plural pill_count %}
   Hi {{ name }}, I took {{ pill_count }} blue pills.
{% endtrans %}
```

You can test it with the ZF2 Skeleton, by translating "Home" to "fr_CA" which becomes "Acceuil" (good test).

#### Known Limitations

Doesn't support text domains, yet.
